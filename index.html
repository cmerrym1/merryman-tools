        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <img src="./assets/images/the-founder.jpg" alt="The founder of Merryman Tool Co., Randy Merryman"/>
        <p>Merryman Tool Co. was founded in 2021 by inventive genious, Randy Merryman. Randy grew up in West Virgina, the youngest of five children. He became a truck driver after he left the army. Randy was always a bit unique in the way his brain saw things. Whenever he would use a product that did not function the greatest he would instantly start thinking of how that product could be made better. He would sketch his designs and notes on any paper he had on hand, envelopes, napkins. ect. Randy became a father in 1992 when his daughter was born. He had to focus on supporting her and he had less time and capital to pursue his inventions. He made prototypes from anything he could, clay, platic, plywood. None of these were particularly suitable materials. Then one Christmas that wonderful bundle of joy he had bought him a 3D printer for making models. And that's where things really took off. A few years later he bought himself a Shapako CNC. Using the designs he had used for the 3D printer he finally had a stainless steel, working prototype of the Adjustable Magnificant Wrench 5000. It wasn't long before he had contracts to sell them in Home Depots across the country. And thus, Merryman Tool Co. was born, a multi-million dollar company in just one year! Randy Merryman is the epitomy of hard work, perserverance, and success. Merryman tools are designed to get the job done right the first time, every time.</p>
